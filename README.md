# CS612 Assignment 4

This project was written with the intent to fulfill the requirements for Pace University's CS612 Assignment 4 submission: design a blog site with ReactJS.

This is a single-page site with links to the three blog posts in the header, along with the top stories in the New York Times in the navigation column. The page will not render until you replace ```KEY_HERE``` in lines 49 and 69 of [App.js](src/App.js) with a NYT API key for top stories. The first blog post introduces me, the author of the site. The second blog post takls about the current trends in remote work and study. The third blog post is a brief high-level tutorial on how to create a blog site similar to this one.

This directory was created with the Create-React-App tool by Facebook, which can be found [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I have included this link here in case you want to get started working with ReactJS to build a site yourself. You do not need to download this for the purpose of getting this site to work.

This site requires downloading [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then also making sure that you have [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).

## Deploying the web server

To get the web server to run, you need to run:

### `npm start`

...from inside the project directory.

From there, you can visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app from your web browser.
